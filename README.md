# EasyEnv
EasyEnv is a Blender Add On which can generate 3D gaussain splatting environment based on a single image. Leverage the technique of ml-sharp (from Apple) and 3DGS Render (from Kiri Engine). 

(put some sample result here)

Although the Add On support CPU, still highly recommend using GPU for faster 3D scene generation
